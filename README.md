# IconBundlesConverter
This is a ruby script that takes old iOS themes and converts them to iOS 8 compatible IconBundles

This project was one of my first scripts written outside of school my sophmore year. It was used by at least 10 iOS Theme developers who were fairly well known within the iOS Jailbreak community. If you have any questions about this project feel free to email me.
